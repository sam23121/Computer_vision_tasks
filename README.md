# Computer Vision Tasks
This repository contains different implementations for computer vision tasks.

## Contents
- A simple notebook demonstrating image segmentation using Detectron2 (to be added)
- A simple notebook showing object detection with YOLOv8
- An agentic object detection implementation that can be used to detect peas, onions and mushrooms in any image. This is a more interesting and direct approach to the problem. Feel free to test it with other images to evaluate its accuracy!

Note: While there were other object detection and segmentation models considered, due to computational resource constraints, only these three approaches were explored. The code does not follow good coding standards or implement a complete end-to-end pipeline - rather, it serves as a demonstration of potential approaches to these computer vision tasks.
